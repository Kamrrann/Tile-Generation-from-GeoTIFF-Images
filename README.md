# Tile-Generation-from-GeoTIFF-Images
This notebook presents a Python script designed to facilitate the generation of smaller tiles from large GeoTIFF images. The process involves partitioning the images into manageable sections, often referred to as tiles, which can be useful for various applications such as processing large datasets in smaller chunks .
